# Ethereum Account Browser SPA
---
Started: 12/11/17

To use the SPA simply enter an Ethereum address into the form and click "submit".

The page will display the 10 most recent transactions this account has made (using https://etherscan.io/apis), which account it was made to, which account it came from, the block number, the value of the transaction, and the balance of the account. You can also search those addresses' transactions as well and view more information.

There is a button to load the next 10 transactions, which runs an ajax function to retrieve the next 10 results from the etherscan api.

I will get a domain for this soon but if you'd like to run it in your browser please clone the repository and use php -S localhost:8000 in your terminal then open localhost:8000 in your browser.
