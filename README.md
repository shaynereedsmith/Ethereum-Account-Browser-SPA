# Ethereum Account Browser SPA
---
12/11/17

To use the SPA simply enter an Ethereum address into the form and click "submit".

The page will display the 10 most recent transactions this account has made, which account it was made to, which account it came from, the block number, and the value of the transaction.

This app will run in the browser. If you'd want to run this locally you will need a local server to run php. Something like XAMPP will help.

I hope you enjoy this app.
