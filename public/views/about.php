      Hi.
      <br />
      <br />
      My name is Shayne.
      <br />
      <br />
      I'm an illustrator and a web developer.
      This is a little app I made to showcase that I can do something.
      <br />
      <br />
      It's built in php with some simple class functionality. Some of it is object oriented, some of it is functional, some of it uses APIs, some of it uses JavaScript. There is also a good amount of CSS (because I like visuals and design).
      <br />
      <br />
      I hope you like it. It was kinda fun to make.
      <br />
      <br />
      And yes: that is a drawing of me. I'm not really purple.
